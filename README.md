## History

This is a prototype mechanical transformation chassis tested during the summer of 1997 in Atacama dessert in Chile by a team comprizing of a few North Americans. This prototype was mainly designed to be used in space rovers and other robots.


## Mechanism
This is a *'Transforming'* chassis which has a simple mechanical linkage of solid arms used to change the footprint of the vehicle from a stowed to a deployed position. This mechanism also permits *Double Ackermann Steering* and *Point-turn Steering*.
